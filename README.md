# pySQL Zoo
A way to showcase my solutions going through the [SQL Zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) using the sqlite3 package in Python.

As I work through the [SQL Zoo Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial), I want a way to showcase the different queries and SQL commands that I'm learning. I settled on converting the different queries that I use to SQLite commands in Python to show that I not only can write SQL queries but also incorporate them in another scripting language. In this case, I chose to use Python.

All of these solutions and scripts are my own personal work.

The databases on which these exercises are based were obtained manually by querying the SQL Zoo databases for the relevant .tsv information.

- ### SQL Queries: Executing SQL queries accurately and in a way that is readable to someone reviewing the queires later.

- ### Documentation: Clean, standardized documentation for my scripts and solutions.
