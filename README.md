# pySQL Zoo
A way to showcase my solutions going through the [SQL Zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) using the sqlite3 package in Python.

As I worked through 9 lessons of the [SQL Zoo Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial), I wanted a way to showcase the different queries and SQL commands that I'm learning. I settled on converting the different queries that I use to SQLite commands in Python to show that I not only can write SQL queries but also incorporate them in another scripting language. In this case, I chose to use Python.

All of these solutions and scripts are my own personal work.

The databases on which these exercises are based were obtained manually by querying the SQL Zoo databases for the relevant .tsv information. To avoid excessive copy/pasting, I wrote a simple Python script to scrape a lot of the data. In the case of Lesson 6, however, the relevant tables had too many entries to feasible copy down (50 at a time due to the SQL Zoo limit), so it's just the raw SQL queries rather than the Python implementation.
