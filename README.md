# pySQL Zoo
A way to showcase my solutions going through the [SQL Zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) using the sqlite3 package in Python.

As I work through the [SQL Zoo Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial), I want a way to showcase the different queries and SQL commands that I'm learning. I settled on converting the different queries that I use to SQLite commands in Python to show that I not only can write SQL queries but also incorporate them in another scripting language. In this case, I chose to use Python.

All of these solutions and scripts are my own personal work.
